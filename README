This is a course Project for CS6150 Advanced Algorithms.

This project solves the problem of Minimum Vertex Cover for a graph. we also try to apply some heutristics to get the faster and efficient answers. 

The current code changes have been stage-by-stage. The design might still require more methods and certain methods can be removed. Currently all the possible functions have been added.

The project members( in alphabetical order):

Mahadevan, Mithun
